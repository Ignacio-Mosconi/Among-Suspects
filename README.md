# Among Suspects

<b>"Among Suspects"</b> is a narrative-driven experience loaded with detective-style gameplay. You play as a young journalist who is invited to a "class reunion" party after having been left amnesiac in a mysterious accident. Trying to recover his memories, our hero decides to attend this party, but things soon take a turn for the worse when the group finds out that one of them was killed during the event. After realizing that they became trapped inside the venue - isolated from the rest of civilization - panic and despair take over: the murderer is within the guests!
